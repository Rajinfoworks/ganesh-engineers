      <h2 class="section-title">Overview of Powder Coating</h2>
      <p>
        Powder coating is a highly durable, environmentally friendly coating process widely used in industrial
        applications. At Ganesh Engineers, we provide premium powder coating solutions for machinery, structural
        components, pipelines, tanks, and other industrial equipment. This process not only enhances the aesthetic
        appeal of surfaces but also significantly improves their corrosion resistance and durability.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our powder coating solutions are designed to withstand harsh environmental conditions, including extreme
        temperatures, chemical exposure, and high humidity. The process involves applying a dry powder electrostatically
        to the surface, followed by curing under heat to form a smooth, protective layer. Unlike traditional liquid
        paints, powder coating does not require solvents, making it eco-friendly and compliant with environmental
        regulations.
      </p>

      <h3>Benefits of Powder Coating</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Long-lasting protection against corrosion, wear, and UV damage</li>
        <li>Eco-friendly process with minimal waste and no volatile organic compounds (VOCs)</li>
        <li>Wide range of colors and finishes for industrial and commercial applications</li>
        <li>High adhesion and uniform coating thickness</li>
        <li>Cost-effective compared to repeated painting and maintenance</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Our Powder Coating Process</h3>
      <p>
        Ganesh Engineers follows a structured and meticulous powder coating process:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Surface Preparation:</strong> Cleaning and sandblasting to remove rust, dirt, and previous coatings</li>
        <li><strong>Pre-treatment:</strong> Chemical or mechanical treatment to improve adhesion and corrosion resistance</li>
        <li><strong>Powder Application:</strong> Electrostatic spraying of powder evenly on the surface</li>
        <li><strong>Curing:</strong> Heating the coated surface in a controlled oven to form a smooth, durable layer</li>
        <li><strong>Inspection:</strong> Quality checks for thickness, adhesion, and finish uniformity</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Applications of Powder Coating</h3>
      <p>
        Powder coating is suitable for a wide range of industrial applications, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Structural steel, beams, and frames for industrial buildings</li>
        <li>Machinery and equipment used in manufacturing plants</li>
        <li>Pipelines, tanks, and storage vessels in chemical and oil & gas industries</li>
