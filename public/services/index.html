      <h2 class="section-title">Why Choose Ganesh Engineers for Surface Protection?</h2>
      <p>
        Ganesh Engineers has been a trusted leader in industrial surface protection since 1996, providing high-quality
        solutions that prevent corrosion, enhance durability, and improve the longevity of machinery, pipelines, tanks,
        structural steel, and industrial equipment. Our expertise spans multiple surface treatment methods, including
        powder coating, sand blasting, epoxy painting, zinc spray, metallizing, and rubber lining. With years of
        experience serving diverse sectors such as oil & gas, power plants, food processing, pharma, heavy engineering,
        and water treatment facilities, we ensure every project meets international quality standards and client
        expectations.
      </p>
      <p>
        We understand that industrial surfaces are exposed to harsh environmental conditions, chemical exposure, and
        extreme temperatures. This makes proper surface treatment critical for maintaining operational efficiency,
        safety, and cost savings. At Ganesh Engineers, we combine advanced technology with experienced applicators to
        deliver durable, high-performance coatings that stand the test of time.
      </p>

        large infrastructure facility, we conduct detailed assessments to recommend the most suitable protection
        techniques. Our focus is on achieving optimal adhesion, uniform coverage, and corrosion resistance while
        ensuring that application processes are environmentally compliant and efficient.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the years, we have developed expertise in handling a wide variety of materials including steel, stainless
        steel, aluminum, and industrial alloys. Our surface treatment solutions are designed to extend the life of
